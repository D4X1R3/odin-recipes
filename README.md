# odin-recipes
This is repo for the project. with recipes from the Odin programm
My current project has several aims: 
1) To get used to Git and terminal commands.
2) To refresh my knowledge about HTML and CSS /! Worry it could be easy at first but then a bit boring !/ 
3) Hopefully learn something new.
